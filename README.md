Hello I’m Deborah, I’m studying App Development through the YearUP program. I’m a member of Coding Allies, a group that supports women minorities thrive in tech. I hope to incorporate my app development knowledge into User Experience and better understand the psychology of building a software.

I've been privileged to have Seattle Central be apart of one of my life chapters. Seattle Central is a melting pot of diverse backgrounds of culture, race, gender, and life experiences. During my first quarter my Math group (for the quarter) consisted of a 76 year old woman who was simply on the quest to improve her mathematics skills, a hispanic male majoring in biology from San Diego, and my now close friend Winnie, an international student from Tanzania. Not only have I met so many incredible people, I've enjoyed my classes and have found wealth in my teachers there beyond the subject. In my English 101 class where my professor was a translator and had translated more than five books from Japanese to English also my Public Speaking teacher taught the same course at a women's federal prison in Washington. Being a student at Seattle Central has been a pivotal transition, I can already see all the positive ways it's contributing to my personal growth.
